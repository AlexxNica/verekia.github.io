Today I'm proud to announce that a "Responsive template" is now available on <a href="http://www.initializr.com/" target="_blank">Initializr</a>! It will help you dealing with all the various devices used to display your site. Mobiles, tablets, netbooks, laptops, desktop monitors, HUGE desktop monitors... Making your site work correctly on all these devices is a real nightmare. Well guess what? This nightmare is... absolutely not over! But as least, the boilerplate code of a responsive layout is now here to make your life easier.
