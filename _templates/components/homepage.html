<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
Hi there! I'm Jonathan Verrecchia, a French software engineer, minimalist, and electronic music producer - amongst other things.
</p>

<p>
This site is where I document projects I'm passionate about. I would recommend starting with my <a href="#">Minimalism Guidelines</a> and my write up about the <a href="#">Future of Humanity</a>. I produce electronic music as <a href="#">Leaf Adventure</a>, so you can give it a listen if you're into this or curious.
</p>

<p>
My resume is available <a href="">here</a>. To sum it up, I used to work at Yelp as a Front-End Engineer in San Francisco, co-wrote a book about HTML5, created Initializr - a popular tool to start HTML5 projects, graduated from EPITA, a French Computer Science school in Paris, and I'm currently working on establishing a lifestyle framework based on minimalism and heavy digitization.
</p>


<p>You can find me on <a href="">Twitter</a>, <a href="">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="">Facebook</a>, and <a href="">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
